### Projects

#### Job Application Tracker 

Initial project idea: 
This was a project for one of our modules where the aim was to learn how to organize different information in useful ways. I wanted to create a job application tracker that was efficient, useful, and creative. The problem that I set out to solve was the lack of organization and often forgotten information when applying to jobs. I am the type of person who applies to jobs and forgets when I applied, what the position entailed, contact info, and more crucial information. My aim was to keep track of the various jobs I may apply to in the future, in order to keep all the important information stored and saved in an organized place. 

Tools I used: 
I used Microsoft Excel to complete this program. This program allowed me to properly separate different data and arrange it to my liking and what works best for me. 

Challenges I faced:
I didn’t encounter too many challenges with this project as I was pretty experienced using Excel for things like this. 

Other Resources: 
No other resources were used for this project. 

Result:
I set out to achieve an organized job application tracker that was easy to use and kept important information easy to access. I definitely did achieve this goal as I feel my job application tracker works great for me and is tailored to what helps me keep track of different things. An improvement I’d make is to make it a bit more detailed and maybe make it more aesthetically appealing and interesting. 

Summary:
This project was great practice on knowing how to organize information, label cells, create different sections, etc. It was also a project that I can genuinely see myself using for future jobs I apply to as I tend to forget important information quickly.

#### Personality Test Application
   
Initial project idea: 
This project was for the final Python Assessment Module. I love sweets and I love baking so I combined my love for desserts with a personality test. I set out to create this personality so people could find out what flavor of cake they are based on fun personality questions. I thought it was a fun way for people to see if their personality aligned with their favorite cake flavor. 

Tools I used: 
I used a Python program to create this personality application. 

Challenges I faced:
Some challenges I faced were thinking of the personality questions and responses that I thought matched each cake flavor, making sure my error checking worked correctly, and correctly adding up the points at the end so that the correct cake flavor displayed. I tried my best to be creative with my questions which took a bit of time but ended up working out for me. I had to run my code numerous times and test different input multiple times to make sure my error checking worked if a wrong input was put in, which took a bit of time due to sometimes incorrectly placing the error message and it not working for invalid input. I also had to correct my range of points multiple times because at first, the number of points was not adding up to the cake flavor that was displayed, or wrong cake flavors were given when it was supposed to be another one based on the range of points I had put. 

Other Resources: 
No other resources were used but I did get some inspiration from Buzzfeed personality quizzes. 

Result:
I set out to achieve a fun, creative personality test where a person could find out their cake flavor based off of questions they answered. I am glad to say that I did achieve this goal. An improvement I would make would be to probably add some more questions, and possibly some weird or unusual questions to spice it up and make it more fun. 

Summary:
In summary this project was a lot of fun and I had a great time writing the code for it, despite the tedious programming and creative thinking that was involved. I would definitely do this quiz if I stumbled upon it and was looking to kill time. I definitely was able to practice all the Python structures, loops, etc. that we learned throughout this module, which I learned a lot from.

#### Creating Queries
   
Initial project idea: 
This project was one of our final ones for this semester and although I initially thought it was going to be very difficult, it ended up being pretty straightforward and I got to learn a lot. I set out to create queries for different items that customers bought at a candy store. These queries allowed me to organize data/information in different ways such as the price in ascending order, purchases made from certain customers and more. 

Tools I used: 
I used Microsoft Access. 

Challenges I faced:
I honestly didn’t have too much trouble with this project as I watched all the lectures and completed the practice activities. Having the instructions and demonstrations was definitely super helpful and made my learning easier. It was overall a smooth process.

Other Resources: 
No other resources were used. 

Result:
I set out to achieve a project that allowed me to separate a lot of data into smaller parts, which would be helpful for future business projects, keeping track of grades, and more. I did achieve this goal. An improvement that I would make if I had the chance would be to create more queries and use more “and” and “or” criteria. 

Summary:
Using Microsoft Access, I developed queries to filter and sort purchases made at a candy store. The process was straightforward and helped me build practical skills in organizing information for business and academic purposes.
