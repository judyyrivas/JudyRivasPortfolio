### About Me 

Hello! I am an experienced Forensic Scientist and a Criminology professional with over 15 years of proven expertise in Psychological profiling and Crime Scene Investigation. 

With skills in problem-solving, meticulous attention to detail, communication, and analytical thinking, I am able to search for various pieces of evidence, and achieve piecing crucial information together. I am adept at using Python, Java Script, and Microsoft programs. 

My meticulous skill set, commitment to integrity, and passion for solving complex cases position me as a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to go hiking, and bake.
